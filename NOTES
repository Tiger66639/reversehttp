Split reversehttp spec into two (or more?) pieces

Write up the interaction with transparent proxies etc

Presence!

Multimedia messaging
 - enclosures
 - linking, transfer; in band, out of band
 - metadata

When considering policies for unsubscription, perhaps include a
generation-number with a subscription? That way, flapping can be
avoided by auto-unsubscribing only a given generation...

Investigate the use of global:register_name to replace the ets table
 - works, but slow; mnesia better?

Orbited?

Fix the request-timeouts in case where a poller is working its way
through a queue. The timeout then should be closer to ANSWER_TIMEOUT
than REQUEST_TIMEOUT. Only in the case where no requests are
in-progress and there are no pollers queued up should requests time
out with REQUEST_TIMEOUT.

Make timeout-downstream and timeout-poller use different response
codes: currently they're both 504.

Make the response-checking happen in the right place: on the replying
side, not the requesting side. Should eliminate the 502 for a
requestor.

Implement deregistration.

Implement some kind of security (authentication/authorisation) hook.
