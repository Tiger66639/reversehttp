# Demos Offline

## Demo service offline

Up until mid-2010, there was a free demo ReverseHttp service running
at `reversehttp.net`, but I have since taken it offline because the
traffic bill was getting too high. If anyone would like to sponsor or
host the publicly-available service, or would like advice on
configuring a service instance of their own for their own use, please
[get in
touch](mailto:tonygarnockjones+reversehttp@gmail.com?Subject=ReverseHTTP+Service).

## Running your own instance of the ReverseHTTP service

The code is open-source, and hosted on github. Please see [the
downloads page](download.html) for information on getting a copy of
the server source code. The README included with the source
distribution contains instructions on setting up and starting the
server.

Please feel free to [contact
me](mailto:tonygarnockjones+reversehttp@gmail.com) at any time if you
have questions, comments, or suggestions.
